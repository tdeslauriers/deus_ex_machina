## Deus Ex Machina

_"God from the machine; a person or thing that appears or is introduced into a situation suddenly and unexpectedly and provides an artificial or contrived solution to an apparently insoluble difficulty."_

* Another rust learning project: this is the second puzzle piece where i use/import the noncryptor crate I published.

**Description**: this is a catch all, kitchen sink cli tool for random command line operations I use a lot.
1. First entry is the base64 crate I made in another learning project since I am often either encoding or decoding base64 and I find bashes piping syntax counter intuitive.
1. I will likely add other encoding schemas next like URL, etc.
1. Eventually, I would like to add hashing, encryption, and client calls.
    * But the entire goal is no cheating by using external crates made by other people.
